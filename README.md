# Hashprize
The vision of Hashprize is to create a prize-linked staking protocol/no-loss lottery that allows participants the chance to win HBAR prize drawings. Hederaâ€™s proxy staking feature is used to allow participants to retain full control and ownership of their HBAR and fund the prize pool by opting to proxy stake to the Hashprize account. Similar crypto protocols have the disadvantage of requiring participants to deposit into a pool usually controlled by smart contracts. Hashprize is unique because there is no smart contract risk, participants do not transfer or lock-up tokens and can opt out anytime by updating their staking choice.
